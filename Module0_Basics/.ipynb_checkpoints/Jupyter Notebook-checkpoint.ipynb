When asking stakeholders in companies in different industries and of various sizes what language they would like their data scientists to know when coming in, Python is a consistently popular choice. If you are going to learn one language (something everyone should do!), Python would be a great choice.\n",

Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.\n",

Usually the session keeps running as long as you don't stop your instance and you keep the notebook window open.  Sometimes when you get errors in running your cells, it's because something from a prior cell was forgotten for some reason.  If you look above under the dropdown menu Kernel above, you'll see that there are options for clearing your outputs, rerunning all the cells, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A script is a (often small) program that can be run as a \"command\". The program code is just text defining commands in certain programming language (e.g. Python). Often scripts cobble other commands into something useful that can be run again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other files on a computer, we identify the type of a script based on the extension of the file. Typically this extension identifies programming language that was used to develop the script, with each language having been assigned a conventional extension. For example, a file called \"script_example.py\" is a file with python commands, and a file called \"script_example.R\" is a file with the R language commands. Other extensions that might be encountered include: \".cpp\", \".scala\", \".php\", \".rb\", \".sh\".\n",

    "One creates a script by opening a text file (with an appropriate name and file extension), typing or pasting in some Python commands, and then saving it.\n",

Often times, we want to write routines that are used by other, more complex systems, or by automated control software. You will see examples of how to do this later!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are plenty of other more powerful text editors that provide other tools to boost productivity. Jupyter is convenient and easy to use, but if you've got a lot of code to write, you may consider [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/2), both of which have a shallow learning curve. I (Carlos) prefer [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to write Python scripts, which is also quite simple to use."
